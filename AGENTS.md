## Package Manager

- Use `bun` for package management in this repository.
- Install dependencies with `bun install`.
- Run package scripts with `bun run <script>`.
- Use `bunx` for one-off CLI execution when needed.
- Do not reintroduce `package-lock.json` or `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

## Codebase Structure

- `front-src/`: frontend source code, including components, shared utilities, styles, and browser-facing type declarations.
- `server-src/`: server source code and the TypeScript entry point for the Node/Express backend.
- `frontend-dist/`: generated frontend build output from Vite.
- `server-dist/`: generated server build output from TypeScript.
- `数独/`: standalone HTML pages and local demos.
- Root config files such as `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, and `eslint.config.js` control the build, type-checking, and linting setup.

## Working Notes

- Prefer editing source files over generated output.
- Treat `frontend-dist/`, `server-dist/`, and `node_modules/` as generated or local-only directories.
- Keep changes consistent with the existing split between frontend and server code.
